% THIS SCRIPT IS USER DEPENDENT!
% The extraction of the data from markers is highly dependent upon the kind
% of dataset the user is dealing with. No generic code can be written
% here!  If you want to use it you have to modify the code by your own.

% Some notes/hints:
% - With this script you'll extract parameters to build your URDF model
%   (e.g., distances between markers) from your own dataset.
% - Once extracted, you'll use these parameters to scale the hand in the
%   URDF template that is in 
%   https://github.com/dic-iit/human-model-generator/blob/master/templates/
